Purpose:
    This folder is intended to hold the launch files for controlling the simulation and real robots.

Notes:
    The code for the pipeline planning node launch comes from the ros-planning project in moveit_tutorials -> doc -> pr2_tutorials -> planning -> launch DRRRRR_> planning_pipeline_tutoial.launch

References:
    Much of the code for this section is modified from the gazebo tutorial.
