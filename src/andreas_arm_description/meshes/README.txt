Purpose:
    This folder is intended to hold the CAD output meshes for simulating the robot.

Notes:
    Meshes for the robot may be in the form of either .dae (COLLADA) files or .stl (STL) files. through the COLLADA files will include the materials in the mesh and can be colored by multiple materials, the STL files must be colored in the robot description.

References:
    Much of the code for this section is modified from the gazebo tutorial.
